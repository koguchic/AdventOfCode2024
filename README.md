# AdventOfCode2024

There are no rules in this repo.  This repo is for educational purposes for people who want to follow the Advent of Code, a series of programming challenges.  It is customary for people to do these daily programming challenges in a programming language they want to try out for the first time or brush up on.  It'll typically enable people to get familiar with the standard library and be able to solve leetcode-style problems.  There is no need to do all of them or even do them in the same order.
