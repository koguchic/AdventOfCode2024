# 1. find the max of both lists
# 2. create 2 arrays of size found in 1
# 3. knowing each number is an integer and could be a repeat, tally occurence in the array index. end up with 2 tallies
# 4. two pointer approach from index 0 of each list till we get to the end. Keep track of running abs(sum)

# brute force memory
